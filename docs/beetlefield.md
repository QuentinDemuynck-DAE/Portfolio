## My Impact

As one of three developers on our six-person Game Jam team at **DAE**, I played a key role in turning our concept into a polished vertical slice. My primary contributions include:

- **Dynamic Map Generation**  
  - Designed and implemented maps that automatically rearrange based on the number of competing teams.  
  - Ensured balanced spawn points and clear sightlines through procedural layout rules.

- **“Speed-Up” Zone Mechanic**  
  - Created a special area where the bomb’s countdown accelerates, adding tension and strategic depth.  
  - Tuned timing curves so that entry and exit feel fair but impactful.

- **Audio Implementation & Composition**  
  - Integrated sound effects.  
  - Created my own effects using Sonic Pi.

- **Player Movement & Controls**  
  - Developed smooth, responsive character movement with acceleration, deceleration, and collision handling.  

- **UI & UX Enhancements**  
  - Created the guide UI in the startscreen

- **Debugging & Smaller Tasks**
